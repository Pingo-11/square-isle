That’s a great mechanic — persistent world changes across multiple runs can add meaningful progression. Here's an abstract system design you can use in Godot to achieve this without duplicating the map for every run:
🔧 Core Concept: A Base Map + World State Modifiers
🧱 1. Use a Base Map as a Template

    Have one base map scene (Map.tscn) that represents the full, unaltered environment.

    Make all potential dynamic elements (e.g. rocks, water, sealed doors, etc.) individual nodes with unique identifiers (names or metadata tags).

🗂 2. Track World Modifications in a Save File

    Create a WorldState resource (e.g. a singleton autoload or saved file) that contains:

    var removed_nodes = {}  # e.g. { "rock_1": true, "water_area_2": true }
    var unlocked_areas = {}  # e.g. { "zone_canyon": true }
    var modification_counter = 0  # how many modifications were made
    var runs_completed = 0

    This stores what has changed across runs rather than duplicating the map.

🔄 3. Modify Map at Runtime Based on World State

    On map load:

        Iterate over relevant nodes.

        Check if their ID is in removed_nodes or similar flags.

        If so, remove or modify them dynamically.

    func _ready():
        for node in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("modifiable"):
            if WorldState.removed_nodes.has(node.name):
                node.queue_free()

🛠 4. Modify the World Post-Run

    After each game run, allow the player to spend a "modification point" to change part of the map.

    These changes are written to WorldState and saved.

    Each change updates modification_counter.

🗺 5. Unlock New Map Sections Based on Progress

    You can unlock new areas based on conditions:

    if WorldState.modification_counter >= 10:
        WorldState.unlocked_areas["hidden_valley"] = true

    On map load, instantiate or activate the new area conditionally.

📦 6. Efficient Scene Design

    Design the map modularly:

        Use separate scenes for chunks of the world (e.g. Zone1.tscn, Zone2_Secret.tscn).

        Add them dynamically based on unlocked_areas.

    if WorldState.unlocked_areas.has("zone_2"):
        var zone2 = preload("res://zones/Zone2_Secret.tscn").instantiate()
        add_child(zone2)

✅ Advantages of This Approach

    Single map scene, dynamically altered.

    No duplication of map files per run.

    Easy to expand over time with new features or zones.

    Persistent world changes feel meaningful and player-driven.

Designing a map in Godot (especially one with dynamic, persistent changes like yours) works best with a modular, data-driven approach. Below is an abstract → practical workflow to help you structure your map efficiently, without creating a mess or too many duplicates.
🧭 High-Level Map Design Strategy

Your map should be composed of modular chunks, which you load and modify at runtime based on world state. Think of it as a layered world:

    Base Layer = Always present

    Modification Layer = Changes per run (destroyed rocks, drained water, etc.)

    Unlockable Layer = Hidden zones/areas gated by progress

🔨 Step-by-Step Map Design in Godot
🔹 1. Use a TileMap for Terrain

    Create a TileMap node for your base terrain (floor, walls, water, etc.)

    Design the main structure of your world here.

    You can also have multiple TileMaps layered (e.g., TileMap_Terrain, TileMap_Objects, TileMap_Decor).

🔹 2. Add Modifiable Nodes as Children

For things the player can modify (like rocks or water barriers):

    Add individual Node2D, Sprite2D, or custom Area2D nodes as children of the scene.

    Give them unique names or metadata to identify them later.

Example:

var node_id = "rock_entrance_01"

Tip: Add these to a group called "modifiable" so they can be easily queried:

func _ready():
    $Rock1.add_to_group("modifiable")

🔹 3. Use Scene Instancing for Map Chunks

Split your map into chunks or zones:

    Each chunk is its own scene: Zone1.tscn, CaveEntrance.tscn, RiverBlocked.tscn, etc.

    Then instance them inside a master World.tscn scene depending on game progress.

if WorldState.unlocked_areas.has("zone_river"):
    var river = preload("res://Zones/RiverBlocked.tscn").instantiate()
    add_child(river)

🔹 4. Design with Layers and Groups

Organize your map in a node tree like:

World.tscn
├── TileMap_Terrain
├── TileMap_Objects
├── Modifiables (Node2D)
│   ├── Rock1 (Sprite2D, in group "modifiable")
│   ├── Water1 (Area2D, in group "modifiable")
├── Doors (Node2D)
├── PlayerStart (Position2D)

This keeps logic clean and modular.
🧠 Persistent Change Logic

Add logic in _ready() or a setup function to remove or modify map parts based on WorldState.

func _ready():
    for node in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("modifiable"):
        if WorldState.removed_nodes.has(node.name):
            node.queue_free()

🗃 Suggested Folder Structure

res://
├── scenes/
│   ├── world/
│   │   ├── World.tscn
│   │   ├── Zone1.tscn
│   │   ├── Zone2_Hidden.tscn
│   ├── objects/
│   │   ├── Rock.tscn
│   │   ├── WaterObstacle.tscn
│   └── player/
├── scripts/
│   ├── WorldState.gd
│   ├── MapLoader.gd

🧪 Extras (Optional Enhancements)

    Use YSort to automatically handle draw order for overlapping objects.

    Tag modifiable objects with metadata (node.set_meta("id", "rock_entrance_01")).

    Design a simple in-game editor UI for the player to spend progress points and choose what to remove/unlock.

how can i debug this stuff when in testing

Debugging persistent world changes and dynamic map loading in Godot can be tricky, especially when changes happen across sessions. Here’s a structured debugging workflow and toolset tailored to your case:
🧪 1. Use WorldState Debug Printouts

Add logging in your WorldState.gd or world loader script to track what's being modified or loaded:

func apply_modifications():
    print("🧱 Removed nodes: ", removed_nodes)
    print("🔓 Unlocked areas: ", unlocked_areas)

Then in your _ready() method of the world scene:

func _ready():
    apply_modifications()

If a node doesn’t behave as expected, this helps you verify if the state file is correct.
🗂 2. Use the Remote Scene Tree (F8)

While running the game:

    Open the Debugger panel (bottom).

    Go to the "Remote" tab in the Scene dock.

    Inspect live node structure, check if:

        Your map chunks are loaded.

        Modifiable nodes exist or are missing.

        Nodes are in the right groups.

You can even right-click a node → "Copy Path" and call print(get_node("path")) to debug specific ones.
🛠 3. In-Game Debug Tools

Add temporary debug UI or shortcuts:
🔸 Show Current WorldState

Attach to a Label or Console Panel:

func _process(delta):
    $DebugLabel.text = "Removed: %s\nUnlocked: %s" % [
        str(WorldState.removed_nodes.keys()),
        str(WorldState.unlocked_areas.keys())
    ]

🔸 Hotkeys for Debugging Actions

func _unhandled_input(event):
    if event.is_action_pressed("debug_clear_worldstate"):
        WorldState.reset()
        print("WorldState reset.")
    if event.is_action_pressed("debug_add_rock_destroy"):
        WorldState.removed_nodes["rock_1"] = true
        WorldState.save()
        print("Rock removed.")

Add those actions in the Input Map under Project Settings.
🧹 4. Temporary Save Clearing Function

If persistent state is bugging out:

func reset():
    removed_nodes.clear()
    unlocked_areas.clear()
    modification_counter = 0
    runs_completed = 0
    save()

Call WorldState.reset() to clear the persistent world during test runs.
🐞 5. Scene Debugging Tips

    Tag problematic nodes with add_to_group("debug") so you can find or isolate them.

    Put this at the end of _ready() to see what’s being affected:

for node in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("modifiable"):
    print("Checking node: ", node.name)
    if WorldState.removed_nodes.has(node.name):
        print("Removing node: ", node.name)

✅ Summary Debug Checklist
🔍 What You Need to Test	✅ Tool or Method
Are nodes loading/unloading?	print() logs + Remote Scene Tree
Is the world state correct?	On-screen debug label or print(WorldState)
Did I save/load the state right?	Watch state file, print after save() and load()
Am I removing the right nodes?	Loop through "modifiable" group and log
Can I reset fast for retesting?	WorldState.reset() bound to hotkey
